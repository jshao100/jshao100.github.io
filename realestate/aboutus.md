We're James & Kat. Full time software engineers and real estate investors. We live in Seattle with our three cats, Jason, Nori and Mukkuru. We love to talk about cats, food and real estate!


### Our story

Kat’s real estate journey began in San Diego in 2018 where she bought two properties, house hacking and renting rooms to students to cover her housing expenses. She was convinced that the next step was investing in cash flowing assets out of state.

James had a different path. He initially invested in ETFs, believing in the long term steady returns. After meeting Kat, she suggested he read *TODO*. He didn't need much more convincing.

We spent a year learning about real estate, researching markets, and setting up processes before deciding on Indianapolis. Once the decision was made, it was only a matter of time before we each bought our first property in late 2019. 

After that, it was full speed ahead. In 2020, we grew our portfolio to thirteen doors. In 2021, we expanded to short term rentals and Louisville, KY.
